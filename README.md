I had Completed the assignment project given by RESOLUTE-AI .
1. used React for writing the the logics and for basic structuring.
2. Tailwind for styling the UI/UX of the page
3. Used firebase to store the data and the authentication of the user
4. Used React Router Dom to create protected route with the help of firebase authentiaction
Thank you for the opportunity I learned many things ,also learned firestore for this assignment and as i build my logic gets more stronger and rigid



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
